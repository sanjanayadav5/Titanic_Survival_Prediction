# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
  Predictive modelling using Machine learning
_______________________________________________________________________
1. Import Libraries:

Import necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning. This includes pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.<br>

2. Load and Explore Data:<br>

Load the Titanic dataset  using pandas. Explore the basic information about the dataset, such as data types, missing values, and summary statistics. Display the first few rows of the dataset to get an initial understanding.<br>

3. Data Preprocessing:<br>

Handle missing values by removing unnecessary columns and filling missing values in relevant columns (e.g., Age, Embarked, Fare) with appropriate values like median or mode.<br>
Convert categorical variables into numerical format using label encoding or one-hot encoding.<br>
Standardize numerical features to ensure they have a similar scale.<br>

4. Train-Test Split:<br>

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. This allows you to train the machine learning model on one subset of the data and evaluate its performance on another independent subset.<br>

5. Train the Model:<br>

Choose a machine learning algorithm such as Random Forest Classifier and train it on the training dataset. The model learns patterns from the input features to predict the target variable (Survived).<br>

6. Evaluate the Model:<br>

Make predictions on the testing set and evaluate the model's performance. Common metrics include accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, which provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.<br>

7. Visualize Results:<br>

Optionally, visualize the feature importance of the model. In this example, a bar plot is created to display the importance of each feature in predicting survival.<br>
